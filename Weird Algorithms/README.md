## Weird Algorithms<br />

**Problem Statement**<br />
Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if it is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows: 3→10→5→16→8→4→2→1
Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.<br />

**Input**<br />
The only input line contains an integer n.<br />

**Output**<br />
Print a line that contains all values of n during the algorithm.<br />

**Constraints**<br />
1≤n≤10<sup>6</sup>.<br />

**Example**<br />

Input:<br />
3<br />

Output:<br />
3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1<br />
